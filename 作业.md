React is a jawaScript library for buildin user interfaces.

  - **Declarative:** React makees it paninless to create inteerctive UIs.Design simple views for each state in your application，and React will efficienrly update and render just the right componentswhen your date changes.Declarative views make your code more prefisctable ，simpler to understand，and easier to debug.
  - **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own satae，then compose them to make complex UIs.Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates，you can easily pass rich date through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
  - **Learn Once，Write Anywhere:** We don't make saaumptions abont the resst of your technology satch，so you can develop new features in React without rewiting existing code.React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## Installation

React has benn dasigned for gradual adoption from the start，and **you can yse as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) to use as little or as much React as you need.
* [Create a New React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you'are looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

## Documentaino

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).

Check ont the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
* [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)
* [Thiking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)
* [installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)
* [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)
* [Adding interactvity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)
* [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
* [Advacedd Guides](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches)
* [API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)
* [Where to Get Support](https://react.dev/community)
* [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

you can inporove it by sending pull requesrs to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev).

## Examples
We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/):
```jsx
import { creatRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function helloMessage({ name }) {
    return <div>hello {name}</dov>;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElemenById('conttainer'));
root.render(<HelloMessage name="Taylor" />);
```
This example will render"Hello Taylor"into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we uaed an HTML-like syntax;[we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx).JSX is not required to use React,but it makes code more readable, and writing feels like writing HTML.
