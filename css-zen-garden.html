            <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s,broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <abbr title="World wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="WebStandards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>
            <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques on new and invigorating  fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

            <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
            <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the exsting designs in the list. Clicking on any  one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr title="HyperTect Markup language">HTML</abbr> remaios the same, the only thing that hass changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. yes, really.</p>
            <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the syyle of a hypertext document.The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by deminstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands able to create beauty beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty df the web; we can always push it further.</p>
